          We believe everyone deserves to walk into an interview feeling prepared, confident, and in control. 
          But let's be honest — interview prep is usually stressful, scattered, and wildly inconsistent.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          That's why we created PrepPair.me: a platform that takes your resume, the job description, 
          and your unique tone — and turns it into a tailored, motivational, step-by-step interview 
          guide in minutes. We go beyond just "questions" and give you coaching-style insights, 
          follow-up support, and smart tools for every round.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Whether you're applying to a startup, a Fortune 500, or switching careers entirely, 
          we're here to make sure you prep better, stress less, and get hired.

          Prep smarter. Show up stronger. Land it.
